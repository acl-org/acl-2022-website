### ACL 2022 Website

This repository contains the HTML files for the ACL 2022 website that was
originally deployed on [Wix](https://wix.com). However, the original website
was taken offline by the company that worked on it. Since it was important for
posterity to preserve the website, the following steps were taken:

- Download a snapshot of the repository from the [Internet
Archive](https://archive.org) from October 2022 using `wget`.
- Perform some semi-automated clean up steps to sanitize HTML in the files.
- Check in the cleaned up HTML files into this repository and enable GitHub
Pages to deploy the website.
- Point https://2022.aclweb.org to the newly deployed website.

Since this is not the original website, some links may not work.
